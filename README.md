### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ychadda/ychadda** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I have some previous coding experience in JavaScript from taking the Intro to Computer Science course in 10th grade, and also at some summer camps. I'm taking this class because I want a solid handle on computer science concepts, because without those it'll be less likely that my coding knowledge sticks and I wouldn't be able to apply it to other computer languages. My other interests include music, where I've play piano and violin and write my own music. If we get to it, I'd like to do something related to neural networks or machine learning. For now, some other project ideas include a digital version of the royal game of ur (ancient board game) or a cricket scoreboard.
